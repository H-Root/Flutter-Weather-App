# flutter-weather-app

My first app using flutter includes some features like fetching using some native mobile APIs (location, network)

## Notes

- App was built for education purpose none of this code in commercial use
- App structure does not reflect my full potential in flutter and I am still a noob in flutter
- This app uses only location service and do not collect data at all from my side
- Icon for this app is from <https://www.pinterest.com/pin/465700417716520918/>
- Weather API is OpenWeather API <https://home.openweathermap.org/>
- In order to run this app you need to create your own key from the API provider and create .env file with the key provided in .local.env and set your key to the key you created

## Todos
